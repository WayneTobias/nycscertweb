### What it feels like . . .
In the beginning you are under water. . .

By the end you are at the top of the food chain!

Programming:
====
In this section of the class we focused on Arrays and SuperArrays.
We also moved into using a Driver file to display our results.

One of the highlights was Conway's <b>The Game Of Life.</b>


| Rules        | Life / Death      | Death  |
| ------------- |-------------| -------------|
| If it has 2 or 3 neighbors | live cell remains alive | right amount of neighbors |
| If it has <2 or >3 neighbors | the cell dies | as if from overcrowding or undercrouding |
| Any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors    | comes to life      |  right amount of neighbors |


The Game of Life is a zero player game.  It represents a simple growth and death pattern based on a few conditions.  The Game of Life becomes more interesting as you discover patterns that repeat, move across the screen, expand, or quietly fade out in an elegant manner.
